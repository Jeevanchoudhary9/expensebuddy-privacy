Privacy Policy for ExpenseBuddy

Effective Date: August 13, 2025

ExpenseBuddy respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

1. Information We Collect
ExpenseBuddy stores expense data and user account details locally on your device or on a backend server URL provided by you in the app settings. We do not collect or store any personal information on our servers.

2. Data Usage
All data you enter is used solely for providing the features of ExpenseBuddy, such as expense tracking, chart summaries, and currency toggling. Data remains under your control.

3. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your information with third parties.

4. Third-Party Services
If you connect to an external backend (such as a self-hosted server), the privacy policy of that backend provider applies.

5. Security
Your data is stored locally or on your chosen backend. Please ensure your backend is secured, as we are not responsible for data breaches on self-hosted servers.
